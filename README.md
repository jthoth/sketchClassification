# Evaluation of Convolutional Neural NetworksArchitectures in Sketches Classification Task

The data used in this work is the TU-Berlin sketch bench-mark2 collected  by  Eitzet al.(2012). we built models using Tensorflow 2.0

to run experiments you need to execute the following command:

```bat
(sketchClassification) C:\Project> python setup.py --data data --model ResNet --batch 32
```
